Automated image segmentatin of scanning electron microscopy images of graphene using U-Net Neural Network

-   Distinguish between pixels in SEM images that correspoind to regions where graphene is and is not present -> material detection

- 90 image dataset with data augmentation (labeled)

- Higher quality data is better than higher quantity

- Classification accuracy of over 90% and F1 score of over 80%

- Transfer learning indications (domain adaptation)

-
